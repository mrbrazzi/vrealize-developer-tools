# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to vRealize Developer Tools!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Questions and Feedback

Have a question? Rather than opening an issue, please ask away on our [Slack](https://bit.ly/vmware-vrdt-slack).

## Reporting Issues

If you have identified a reproducible problem or have a feature request, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/vmware/vrealize-developer-tools/issues/new/choose).

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/vmware/vrealize-developer-tools/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment (üëç for upvote or üëé for downvote).

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Issue Reports

-   File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
-   Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's related. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
-   When filing bugs, please follow the [bug template](https://github.com/vmware/vrealize-developer-tools/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include as much information as possible. The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
